## Overview
Blood group detection using fingerprint patterns is an emerging technology that provides a quick and non-invasive way to identify blood types. This project leverages deep learning, specifically CNNs, to analyze fingerprint images and predict the corresponding blood group. 

The main aim is to facilitate easier and faster blood group identification through image processing techniques.

## Features
- User-friendly web interface to upload fingerprint images
- CNN model for accurate blood group classification
- Real-time results displayed on the web application
- Error handling for incorrect file formats and unsupported images

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS
- **Backend**: Flask
- **Machine Learning**: Convolutional Neural Network (MobileNetV2) for blood group detection
- **Database**: SQLite (for user credentials and uploads)
- **Deployment**: (Specify if using Heroku, AWS, etc., or leave blank if running locally)
